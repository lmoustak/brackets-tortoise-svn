# Brackets TortoiseSVN
(WINDOWS ONLY) A TortoiseSVN menu extension for Brackets.

## Features
Adds TortoiseSVN commands (commit, checkout, update, revert, log) in File menu and directory tree context menus.

## Prerequisites
TortoiseSVN must be installed. Supports Windows only.

## License
Published under the MIT license. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for more details.

## Notes
This is my first repository on GitHub, and first Brackets extension (and first extension overall). So it may be a little rough around the edges.
